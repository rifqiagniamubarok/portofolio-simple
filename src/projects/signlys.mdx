# Background

Recently, I had the need to create a feature that enables signing PDF documents directly on the web (React). After searching around, I couldn't find an open-source library that fully addressed this need. So, I decided to combine several existing libraries to build this feature.

The result of my research is a project called Singlys. I developed it as a personal project and deployed it for my own use. With Singlys, I feel more secure as no document data is stored, ensuring the confidentiality of all inputs.

# Key features:

- Easy copy-and-paste functionality for signatures.
- Apply signatures to multiple files at once.
- A familiar layout similar to other editing applications.

I understand that this web app is far from perfect, but I am committed to enhancing it with several new features.

# Upcoming features:

- Add image functionality.
- Add text functionality.
- Add shape functionality.
- Resizing elements.
- Mobile responsiveness.

If you face a similar problem, feel free to use Singlys. And if you have suggestions, Iâ€™d be more than happy to hear them!
